An Object Detection Application Let Kids Learn with AI

## Features

This is an object detection application based on [YOLOv5 v6.1](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/v6.1) and [COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home).
It can show informations about the detected objects. Also a it can read those descriptions by [Google TTS](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech).
